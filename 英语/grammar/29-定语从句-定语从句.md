#### 一. 定语从句的构成(n + 引导词+ 句子)

n{先行词} + [引导词+句子){从句}

#### 二. 定语从句的引导词

==引导词按照先行词的种类==分5类

 	1. 人: who whom whose (that 最好不用,用who指人吧📌)
 	2. 物: that which whose
 	3. 时间: that which when 
 	4. 地点: that which where 
 	5. 原因: that which why

引导词按照先行词本身的词性分类

1.   who whom that which

2.   where when why

3.   whose
