##### 如何识别宾语从句

1.   宾语前面是实义动词. 实义动词后面有引导词就暂定为📌宾语从句(还有可能是状语从句).

*   she said (that) she would marry a rich old man

​	==*名词性从句中, 只有宾语从句的that 可以省略*==

 	==*if 只能引导宾语从句,  wether 能引导所有的名词性从句*==

​	==主语前一定是状语==

*   this alone _<u>demonstrates</u>_📌 that the television business is📌 not an easy world to survive in, A fact underlined by statistics shows that **out of** eighty European television networks no less that 50% took a loss in 1989.

    >   demonstrate   
    >
    >   1.  *vi.* 举行示威游行(或集会)
    >   2.  *vt.* 说明, 演示
    >   3.  论证, 证明
    >   4.  显示, 表露
    >
    >   out of  1 在…之中  2 在..之外
    >
    >   主渭滨, 宾语又是主系表结构

*   He believes that this very difficulty may have had the <u>compensating</u> advantage of forcing him to think long and <u>intently</u> about every sentence . and thus enabling him to detect errors <u>in reasoning</u> and in his own observations.

    >   定语太长, 应该后置. 先说重要的话, 在说修饰语.
    >
    >   compensation  补偿, 补偿物
    >
    >   in doing sth  在…的过程中.
    >
    >   **intent**
    >
    >   1.  n. 意图；目的；含义

    >
    >   

*   You have all heard it repeated that men of science work by means of induction and deduction , that by the help of these operations, they, in a sort of sense, manage to extract from nature <u>certain</u> natural laws, and that out of these , by some special skill of their own, they build up their theories.
